            <p>I believe that good design is that sense of harmony between the aesthetic and the goals of a project.</p>
            <p>After a 3-year hiatus, the relaunch of the Paul Lucas Graduate Conference needed a design that would stand out visually from other grad conferences. This design was meant to be both cheap and efficient to print posters, as well as increase legibility in a social media feed.</p>

            <h2>Personal Academic Website, 2021</h2>
            <p>The aesthetic of a project should serve a purpose beyond looking nice. It should offer cues as to function, uses, and possibilities. It bridges the gap between the project and the user.</p>
            <p>I wanted this design to offer both an overview of my work in a way that was flexible enough to encompass both my academic and non-academic interests.</p>

            <h2>Personal Academic Website, 2021</h2>
            <p>The design serves the goal rather than the opposite. The goal for this site was simply to publicize a Curriculum Vitae.</p>
            <p>The design is an exploration of defaults. Drawing on both unstyled HTML and the standard academic paper design, the goal was to emphasize the text. The design itself was meant to polish and modernize those defaults styles, creating a fast, simple, and accessible site.</p>

            <h2>Short Run Color Zine, 2020</h2>
            <p>I was experimenting with alternate ways to present my research into art, architecture, and design, and this zine reignited a semi-dormant interest in design. Part of this experiment was scaling the gap between an idea in Figma, Illustrator, or Photoshop and a physical result. Actually printing and distributing the zine was an important step in designing for a larger audience than myself.</p>

        <p>While much of my design work is mainly oriented towards print, I believe that my design approach is one that is well-suited for UI/UX design as well. I care about the people using something and the details of how they use it. In the case of my print work, it mainly is informational. In terms of digital design, it is attention to the ambiguity of digital space. There is a sense of possibility in digital design. The sheer possibility of it all means it is important to offer both direction and flexibility; a sense of space and the ability to be in it. The key difference between print and digital is the innate sense of space embedded in print. Establishing that same sense in a digital format is one of the main roles of design.</p>
        <p>I am a strong believer in designing with an ethos of negative space. Rather than try to exert control over every pixel in every possible edge case, I believe in creating a flexible system and then catching edge cases at the end. The use of ViewHieght and ViewWidth in CSS, for example, enables a design approach that creates a layout dynamically. The size, positioning, and layout all operate not as set values but as relative ones. This offloads the complexity to the system or the browser. In this sense, I am a strong believer in the value of a slightly modified default. By adjusting the default to suit your needs, you not only engage the user on familiar territory, but can focus energy on adjusting the default rather than building from the base. This is the ethos of negative space I try to bring to my design.</p>
